## Description
InvestaVisor is an educational investment utility designed to help users develop
clarity, discipline, and consistent habits when engaging with stock investing.
In the current landscape, many people rely on AI tools for guidance, but the
quality of the output is highly dependent on the quality of the prompts provided.
Most users are not experienced in prompt engineering, which often leads to vague,
misleading, or overly generic responses.

The goal of InvestaVisor is to remove this burden from the user entirely.
Instead of requiring users to interact directly with an AI model, the application
collects a small set of structured inputs such as investment horizon, risk
appetite, and general preferences. Based on these inputs, the system internally
constructs well-defined prompts and generates structured daily investing plans.
These plans focus on high-level guidance, discipline reminders, and educational
insights rather than asset recommendations or trading signals.

InvestaVisor is intentionally designed as a utility rather than an expert system.
It does not recommend buying or selling any financial instruments and does not
attempt to predict market movements. The application emphasizes reflection,
consistency, and long-term thinking, helping users stay focused without
overwhelming them with alerts or excessive information. All plans generated by
the system are stored so that users can review past outputs and observe patterns
in their own behavior over time.

From a technical perspective, the project demonstrates the integration of
multiple technologies taught in CS50. The backend is implemented using Python
and Flask, with SQLite used for persistent storage. A small C module is included
to illustrate native code integration for simple risk allocation logic.
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive
single-page user experience. The overall design prioritizes simplicity,
privacy, and extensibility, with future support for optional AI integration.

InvestaVisor is strictly an educational project and is not a financial advisor.
Users are encouraged to consult qualified professionals before making any
investment decisions.
