## Description

InvestaVisor is an educational investment utility designed to help users develop
clarity, discipline, and consistency in their approach to stock investing. In
recent years, artificial intelligence tools—particularly large language models—
have become widely accessible. While these tools can be powerful, the usefulness
of their output depends heavily on how well users are able to formulate prompts.
Many everyday users are not familiar with prompt engineering concepts, which often
results in vague, generic, or misleading guidance.

The core purpose of InvestaVisor is to remove the need for users to interact with
AI systems through free-form prompts. Instead of asking users to figure out how
to phrase questions, the application provides a structured interface that collects
a small and focused set of inputs. These inputs include basic personal context and
an investment profile covering factors such as risk appetite, investment horizon,
and general preferences. Based on this information, the system internally
constructs structured prompts and produces consistent, repeatable outputs.

The daily plans generated by InvestaVisor are intentionally high-level. Rather
than recommending specific securities or attempting to predict market movements,
the application focuses on providing sanity checks, discipline reminders, and
educational insights. This approach reflects the belief that long-term investing
success is often driven more by consistent behavior and thoughtful decision-making
than by short-term predictions or reactive trading.

InvestaVisor is explicitly positioned as a utility rather than an advisory system.
It does not provide buy or sell recommendations, portfolio optimization strategies,
or performance forecasts. Instead, it helps users reflect on their habits, stay
focused on long-term goals, and maintain consistency over time. All generated plans
are stored and can be reviewed later, allowing users to observe patterns in their
own behavior and engagement.

A key design principle of InvestaVisor is simplicity. The user interface is kept
minimal to reduce cognitive overload and ensure accessibility for users with
varying levels of technical experience. The application is implemented as a
lightweight web-based system that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile
devices. Because it runs in a browser, it can be used as a desktop application,
a mobile application, or a progressive web-style experience without requiring
separate native builds.

From a technical perspective, InvestaVisor demonstrates the integration of
multiple programming languages and technologies within a single cohesive system.
The backend is implemented in Python using the Flask framework. Flask was chosen
for its simplicity, flexibility, and suitability for building lightweight web
applications. The backend exposes REST-style API endpoints that handle user
authentication, profile management, plan generation, portfolio tracking, and
event logging.

SQLite is used as the database for persistent storage. It provides a lightweight,
file-based solution that is easy to set up and maintain, making it suitable for
an MVP-scale application. The database stores user accounts, personal details,
investment profiles, generated plans, portfolio holdings, and system events.
This structure supports both core functionality and basic analytics.

To demonstrate multi-language integration, InvestaVisor includes a small C module
responsible for basic risk allocation logic. This module is compiled as a shared
library and accessed from the Python application. While the logic itself is kept
simple, its inclusion illustrates how native code can be integrated into a
higher-level application for performance, extensibility, or instructional value.

The frontend is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Rather than relying
on large frontend frameworks, the application uses vanilla JavaScript to manage
user interactions and communicate with backend APIs. This approach keeps the code
base easy to understand and maintain while ensuring that the application remains
responsive and usable across different devices and screen sizes.

Privacy and ethical considerations are central to the design of InvestaVisor. No
personally identifiable user data is sent to any AI model. In the current version,
the application can operate entirely without calling external AI services,
allowing it to run at zero cost and without external dependencies. The
architecture, however, is designed to support optional AI integration in future
versions through user-funded subscriptions.

Overall, InvestaVisor demonstrates how AI concepts can be applied responsibly and
practically. Rather than attempting to replace human judgment, the application
focuses on supporting better thinking habits through structure, consistency, and
reflection. It is designed to empower users, not overwhelm them.

InvestaVisor is strictly an educational project. It is not a financial advisor and
does not provide investment advice. Users should consult qualified financial
professionals before making any investment decisions.

## Technology Stack

- **C** – Native module for basic risk allocation logic  
- **Python** – Backend application logic  
- **Flask** – Web framework for API and routing  
- **SQLite** – Persistent data storage  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Frontend user interface  

The application is web-based and works seamlessly as a desktop and mobile
application through modern web browsers.

## Files

- `app.py` – Main Flask application and API routes  
- `models/` – Database access and persistence logic  
- `services/` – Business logic and plan generation  
- `templates/` – HTML templates for the user interface  
- `static/` – CSS and JavaScript assets  
- `schema.sql` – SQLite database schema  

## Design Decisions

Several design decisions were made to balance simplicity, clarity, and
extensibility. Flask and SQLite were selected to minimize setup complexity and
keep the application portable. A web-based architecture was chosen to allow the
same codebase to serve desktop and mobile users. The inclusion of a C module was a
deliberate choice to demonstrate multi-language integration rather than to
optimize performance. Overall, the project prioritizes maintainability,
responsible use of AI concepts, and a clear separation of concerns.
